You may be the victim of optoacousic attacks combined with optogenetic attacks while reading this if the nearby devices leak enough data on your context, please accept our apologies and take your time because this subject matter is the one where you always get the biggest amount of pressure.

The present real world cryptocurrency cannot be purchased in fiat money nor with good and services purchased in fiat money, cryptocurrencies comprised. Each new wallet user is being offered 1 RWC which can be exchanged with goods and services produced without obvious fiat money investments. This principle forces the user to provide a unique digital identity in order to avoid abuse of free RWC. Reasonable proposals are expected to solve this problem.

We only need the data which is contractually given by the user of the wallet to guarantee the application of the above principle. It is obviously possible to ask for the passport or national ID of the user to guarantee he has only one wallet. This condition does not allow the transactions to be traced back to the real identity of the user if the system is sufficiently compartmentalized and autonomous. Particular attention shall be given to the cases of wallet recovery in order to avoid leakage of knowledge for example with bruteforce attacks. All the code shall obviously be open and previously collectively reviewed.

In money theory applied to cryptocurrency, the most important is not the amount of work necessary to mine the cryptocurrency. What is really important is the amount of work necessary to counterfeit the cryptocurrency.

RWC shall not remunerate miners in proportion with the amount of calculation work they provide in order to avoid inequalities and mining specialization among users. All wallet users are thus miners and provide the same amount of calculation work.

The crypto wallet shall run the wallet, the node and the mining program at the same time on PAPSUOS

The network traffic shall be invisible on port TCP 443

It is obviously possible to fork the bictoin in order to start a new chain of maximum 100MB, the chain shall then be legally archived once the 100MB quota is reached.
